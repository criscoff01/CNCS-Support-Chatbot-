*****Current Chabot Status - FULLY FUNCTIONAL

Base Requirements: 
-Python 3.12+ (I use 3.12.1) (PATH VARIABLES MUST BE SET PROPERLY FOR SCRIPTS AND PYTHON ITSELF)
-Flask webframework
-A web browser 
-An IDE of your choosing (I use VS Code)

How to install Flask:
-for WINDOWS users simply navigate to your IDE and create a terminal
    -run "pip install Flask"
-for MAC users the command is a little different
    -run "pip3 install Flask" 

If you need more help, here is a short video I used to install it myself 
- https://youtu.be/6EJklo3Kpr4?si=MHuzlI6P66JhFs7H (1 minutes and 53 seconds long)

to run the application please ensure that the folder structure is as follows:

static (folder)
    chatbot.css
    chatbot.js 

templates(folder)
    index.html

app.py
create_database.py


Running the program:

Step 1. run "create_database.py" 
    -in the terminal is should say the database was created and populated successfully

Step 2. run "app.py" 
    -from the terminal a link to the localhost port 5000 will be displayed
    -simply hold down left control and click the link 
    -this should open up your default web browser and display the sample website for CNCS along with my chatbot component in the bottom right corner

IF you run into issues or clicking the link does not work HAVE NO FEAR
    -simply navigate to your web browser and in the search bar enter "localhost:5000"

    *please note that app.py MUST be actively running in the terminal in order for anything to show up*

Step 3. Test the implemented features 

Step 4. When finished testing the chatbot
    -close the web browser 
    -navigate back to the terminal where app.py is running
    -be sure your cursor is clicked into the terminal and press the shortcut "control + c" (or Command + c if on a MAC) to shutdown the flask server

    IF the shortcut command does not close the server, simply terminate the terminal window.
