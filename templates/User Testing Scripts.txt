-----SCRIPTED USER SCENARIOS FOR TESTING-----


All scenarios will assume the User ID of 1 for testing purposes and ease of use in gathering data.
Please note that in a full-scale deployment scenario the user account system from the proposed company would be directly integrated into the chatbot system that I have developed

Below are the scenarios that were utilized to test the usability of the system with my surrogate testers: 

Scenario 1 - You placed an order with CNCS a few days ago and are trying to locate information on when it will be delivered
- your order number is 3 (For the sample data, order numbers can range from 1-5.)

Scenario 2 - You are struggling with a technical issue on your newly purchased desktop computer from CNCS. You are trying to find contact information for a department that you think would be helpful in resolving your issue.

Scenario 3 - Upon further inspection of your newly purchased laptop, you realized there is a deep scratch in the screen before even removing the protective film from shipping. You need to find out whether are not there are warranties on CNCS products and need to get in contact with customer service

Scenario 4 - You are looking to upgrade your set up with new computer and monitor. You are trying to see what products CNCS has available to see if they might have what you are looking for at the right price and whether or not the items are in stock. 

Scenario 5 - You need to get in contact with the returns department
